  <title>Putting all together</title>
  <para>
    So far we have seen the most important objects involved doing an audio processing
    tree. Now we want to do complete example putting all together. In this example we
    instantiate AgsAudioThread and AgsChannelThread to play a simple pattern. The sound
    we use is generated using a sine wave.
  </para>
  
  <para>
    In order that the threads are used we provide an appropriate AgsConfig. Further we
    define an AgsPattern and add the needed recalls to do playback using the AgsFxFactory.
  </para>

  <para>
    The example creates 2 different AgsAudio objects. One called master which does the
    actual playback and a second called slave doing the sequencer work. Since the slave
    is linked to the master, we only have to start slave, which initializes the audio
    tree for playback.
  </para>

  <para>
    Note, here thread-safety doesn't matter. If you need to do more complex work-flows,
    you have to care about it. In practice you wouldn't make direct use of any struct
    fields. Rather use the appropriate getter/setter functions and take care of owner
    ship.
